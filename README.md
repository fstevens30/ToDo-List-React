# To Do App

## Made with React Native

### Tools

Built using the following;
- [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)
- [Expo](https://expo.io/)

I also used [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kL6nhutjQ8) by [Matt Frances](https://github.com/mattfrances) as a start point.

### Setup

The project at this stage can only be run in a local enviroment using Expo.

To run the project locally, you will need to have Expo installed on your machine. You can find the installation instructions [here](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/introduction/installation.html).

Once you have Expo installed, you can run the project by running the following command in the root directory of the project.

```bash
expo start
```

Then you can run the project on your local machine using the Expo app on your phone or using an emulator.
